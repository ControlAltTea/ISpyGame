This game was created with 3D art, texture, and material creation in mind. The basic idea is identical to an iSpy book. From the list of items, click what you see before the time runs out. When hovering over items, a colorful outline will appear, indicating that the object can be selected. If correctly selected, an animation will play on the Items List, crossing out the spotted item.

## Tech Used : ![Blender](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Blender-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![UnityEngine](https://img.shields.io/badge/-UnityEngine-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)![SubstancePainter](https://img.shields.io/badge/-SubstancePainter-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=appveyor)

Using Unity to create the outline shader and mouse detection, we then created every 3D object using Blender to model and Substance Painter to create textures and materials.

(At the time of writing this, the game currently runs on Unity 2020.1.5f)

## Optimizations

This project was mostly an exercise in project and asset management. Since there were so many pieces, it was critical that naming conventions, folder management, and other areas of accessibility were taken into account.

## Lessons Learned

Many! Creating shaders in Unity for one. Incorporating it into interesting gameplay and assembling a scene to be aesthetically pleasing. Also, learning how to trigger events, including various gameplay UI.
